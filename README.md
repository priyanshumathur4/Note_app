# Andriod_Note_App

Overview
This Notes Android app, developed using Java and Firebase, is designed to provide users with a seamless experience for managing their notes. It allows users to sign in via Google, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their notes. The app utilizes fragments to handle different screens within a single activity.

Features
Google Sign-In:

Users can authenticate using their Google accounts. This feature is implemented using Firebase Authentication to ensure a secure sign-in process.
View Notes:

After signing in, users are presented with a list of their notes. This view uses a RecyclerView to display notes in a scrollable list format.
Add Notes:

Users can add new notes through a dedicated interface. This feature is accessible via a FloatingActionButton that leads to a form where users can input note details.
Edit Notes:

Existing notes can be updated. Users can access this feature by selecting a note from the list, which opens an edit form pre-filled with the note's current content.
Delete Notes:

Users have the option to remove notes from the list, providing a way to manage and organize their notes effectively.
